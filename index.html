  An overview of the basics of programming
</h1>

<b>5 ways of Thinking</b><br>

<br>One of the most important things when you start to learn code
 is begin to <em>think like a programmer</em>.
<br>This way of thinking is divided, as you can guess from the title,
 into <b>5 ways of thinking</b>:

<p>1. <b>Procedural Thinking</b>
 <br>It means creating perfectly clear and unambiguous instructions
 for a computer to follow.
</p>

<p>2. <b>Abstract Thinking</b>
 <br>Find similarity between apparently different things.
</p>

<p>3. <b>Systematic Debugging</b>
 <br>Is a systematic process to identify and track down 
 potential causes of a computer program that doesn't work 
 until to find the problem and fix it.
</p>

<p>4. <b>Technological Empathy</b>
 <br>It means start to think in the way the computer would
 (e.g. when you see < b >Hello !< /b > the first thing you
 should think about is that <b>Hello!</b> is bold !)
</p>

<p>5. <b>Systems Thinking</b>
 <br>Take a big problem and break the solution into a set of steps.
 Programmers do this when they create
 a plan (often on paper) for how a program will work.
</p>

<b>The Basics of The Web</b>
<p>The Basics of the Web are:
 <br>- <b>The Web</b>
 <br>- <b>HTML</b> (<em>main document type of the web</em>)
 <br>- <b>URLs</b> (<em>how you refer to document on the web</em>)
 <br>- <b>HTTP</b> (<em>protocol that unites the web</em>)
 <br>- <b>Web Applications</b>
</p>

<b>World Wide Web</b>
<p>The Web was invented in <em>1990</em> and it has <em>30 billion pages</em>.
It is a collection of <em>HTML documents</em>.<br>
 <br>But how does it works ?
 <br>If we consider just the major pieces, <b><em>a computer + a browser</em></b>, 
 <b><em>the internet and servers</em></b>, the web works like this:
 <br>the browser makes a request via the internet to servers.
 These requests use a <em>protocol</em> called HTTP, and the servers respond
 with files that the browser displays on the computer.
 <br> If this is not clear enough, there's a

</p>

<b>HTML</b>
<p>HTML is the acronym of <em>HyperText Markup Language</em> and it is made up of:
 <br>- Text content --> what you see
 <br>- Markup --> what it looks like
 <br>- References to other documents --> e.g. images and videos
 <br>- Links to other pages
</p>

<p>The <em>text content</em> is literally the text as it is written.
</p>

<p>The <em>Markup</em> is made up of <em>tags</em>, the opening and
  the closing tag that together the <em>text content</em>
  they form an <em>element</em>.
  <br>e.g. < b > contents < /b > is a tag to make a text <b>bold</b>,
  < em > content < /em > is to make a text <em>italic</em>.
</p>

<p><em>Attributes</em> are used to display an image or link to a video or a website.
  <br>The <em>anchor</em> tag is used to link a website or a video to a text
  < a href="link"> derp< /a > and it works like this -->
  <a href="www.udacity.com"> Udacity</a>.
  <br>The <em>img</em> tag is used to display images < img src="url" alt="text" >
  and it works like this -->
  <img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/tAZ1z5QqHrDdq2X4cLa3Ut2c1TBArhgf5SY6HPZl4qfu69HsIxSdnVm0ZAOUmO9PELVZ=w75" alt="sample">
  <br>This is a void tag, a tag that has no content and it doesn't need a closing tag.
</p>

<b>Whitespace</b>
<p>It is the space between multiple lines created by:
  <br>- < br >, break tag (void tag).
  <br>- < p > contents < /p >, paragraph tag
</p>

<p>To understand why we have two ways of making lines, we need to talk about:<br>
  <br>- <b>Inline</b>
  <br>- <b>Block</b><br>
  <br><em>Inline</em> tags, like < br >, < a >, < img > and < span >, simply create a lines.
  <br><em>Block</em> tags like < p > and < div > instead create a box, that surrounds the text,
  which has a height and width.
